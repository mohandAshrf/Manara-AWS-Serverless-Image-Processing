## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a **serverless image processing application** on AWS that automatically processes images uploaded to an S3 bucket. The system uses EventBridge and Step Functions to orchestrate a multi-stage image processing pipeline that resizes images and adds watermarks, with full metadata tracking in DynamoDB.

### Architecture Type
**Serverless Event-Driven Architecture**

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ RESTful API for image upload and retrieval
- ‚úÖ Automatic event-driven image processing pipeline
- ‚úÖ Image resizing and watermark application
- ‚úÖ Metadata tracking in DynamoDB
- ‚úÖ Secure API key authentication
- ‚úÖ Cost-efficient and auto-scaling
- ‚úÖ Complete workflow orchestration with Step Functions

### Architecture Flow

1. **Image Upload** ‚Üí User uploads image via API Gateway POST `/upload`
2. **S3 Storage** ‚Üí Image stored in `uploaded/` prefix in S3 bucket
3. **EventBridge Trigger** ‚Üí S3 event triggers EventBridge rule on `uploaded/` prefix
4. **Step Functions Orchestration** ‚Üí EventBridge invokes Step Functions workflow
5. **Lambda Processing Pipeline:**
   - **new-size-image**: Resizes the uploaded image
   - **add-watermark**: Adds watermark to resized image
6. **Final Storage** ‚Üí Processed image saved to `FINAL-IMAGES/` folder
7. **Metadata Storage** ‚Üí DynamoDB stores complete image metadata
8. **Image Retrieval** ‚Üí Users can retrieve images and metadata via API Gateway

### Architecture Components

#### 1. **Amazon API Gateway** (dev stage)
- **Base URL:** `https://4qynjac488.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`
- **Rate Limiting:** 10,000 requests/second
- **Burst:** 5,000 requests
- **Security:** API Key authentication (time-limited access)

**API Endpoints:**
| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| POST | `/upload` | Upload new image |
| GET | `/get-image-metadata/{file-name}` | Retrieve raw uploaded image and metadata |
| GET | `/get-processed-image/{file-name}` | Retrieve processed image and metadata|

#### 2. **AWS Lambda Functions** (Python 3.9)
- **upload-image**: Handles image upload to S3
- **get-image-metadata**: Retrieves raw uploaded image from S3 and metadata from DynamoDB
- **get-processed-image**: Retrieves processed image from S3 and metadata from DynamoDB
- **new-size-image**: Resizes uploaded images
- **add-watermark**: Adds watermark to images

#### 3. **Amazon S3 Bucket** (`mybucketmohand-ashrf`)
- **uploaded/**: Stores original uploaded images
- **FINAL-IMAGES/**: Stores processed images

#### 4. **Amazon EventBridge**
- Monitors S3 events on `uploaded/` prefix
- Triggers Step Functions workflow on new uploads

#### 5. **AWS Step Functions**

Orchestrates the image processing workflow:
```json
{
  "Comment": "Process uploaded image from S3 and save results",
  "StartAt": "update-size",
  "States": {
    "update-size": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:075120018869:function:new-size-image:$LATEST",
      "Next": "add waterark"
    },
    "add waterark": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:075120018869:function:add-watermark:$LATEST",
      "End": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### 6. **Amazon DynamoDB**
**Table Name:** `image-metadata`

**Sample Item Structure:**
```json
{
  "image-id": "upload-20250929_222931-cc1d9991.png",
  "bucket": "mybucketmohand-ashrf",
  "content_type": "image/png",
  "created_date": "2025-09-29T22:29:32.078198",
  "has_transparency": true,
  "height": 859,
  "image_format": "PNG",
  "mode": "RGBA",
  "s3_url": "https://mybucketmohand-ashrf.s3.amazonaws.com/upload-20250929_222931-cc1d9991.png",
  "size_bytes": 1224511,
  "uploaded_at": 1759184972,
  "width": 889
}
```

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Monthly Cost Breakdown (Estimated for 1,000 images/month)

| Service | Usage | Cost |
|---------|-------|------|
| **API Gateway** | 3,000 requests | $0.01 |
| **Lambda Invocations** | 5,000 invocations | $0.10 |
| **Lambda Duration** | 5,000 GB-seconds | $0.83 |
| **Step Functions** | 1,000 state transitions | $0.03 |
| **S3 Storage** | 10 GB storage | $0.23 |
| **S3 Requests** | PUT/GET requests | $0.05 |
| **DynamoDB** | On-Demand, 1K writes, 3K reads | $1.50 |
| **EventBridge** | 1,000 events | $0.00 (Free tier) |
| **CloudWatch Logs** | 1 GB logs | $0.50 |
| **Data Transfer** | 5 GB out | $0.45 |
| **TOTAL** | | **~$3.70/month** |

### Cost Optimization Tips
- ‚úÖ Use S3 Lifecycle policies to archive old images to S3 Glacier
- ‚úÖ Optimize Lambda memory allocation (currently using default)
- ‚úÖ Use DynamoDB on-demand pricing for unpredictable workloads
- ‚úÖ Enable CloudWatch Logs retention policies (7-30 days)
- ‚úÖ Monitor and adjust API Gateway caching if needed
- ‚úÖ Consider using S3 Transfer Acceleration only when needed

**For 10,000 images/month:** ~$25-35/month
